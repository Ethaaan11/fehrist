## Dogtown

**Synopsis**

Dogtown is a heartwarming and adventurous story about a three-legged dog named Chance, a robot dog named Metal Head, and a mouse named Mouse who live in a shelter for stray dogs, misbehaving dogs, and discarded robot dogs, whose owners have outgrown them.

Chance has been in Dogtown since her owners unwittingly left her with irresponsible dog-sitters who skipped town. Metal Head is a robot dog who dreams of being back in a real home. And Mouse is a mouse who has the run of Dogtown, pilfering kibble and performing clever feats to protect the dogs he loves.

When Metal Head hatches a plan to escape Dogtown, he convinces Chance and Mouse to join him on his adventure. Along the way, they face many challenges, including a dangerous cat gang, a runaway truck, and a hungry coyote. But they also learn the true meaning of friendship, courage, and home.

As Chance and Metal Head journey further and further from Dogtown, Chance begins to wonder if she wants to leave her shelter home behind. She has made so many friends at Dogtown, including Metal Head and Mouse. And she has learned to love the shelter's caretaker, Ms. Johnson.

But Chance also knows that she deserves a loving family of her own. In the end, Chance and Metal Head both find the homes they have been dreaming of. But they also learn that home is more than just a place. It's about the people and animals you love.
